JARVIS : The Data Mining Robot is a virtual robot built for scraping the Corporate
Action data which is available on the web. Though this data is available free of cost on the
web there are some data venders who charge high because it's difficult to find the right data
for the right company in the right format. That is where Jarvis comes into action, it surfs the
web based in the user requirements, finds the right data and then scraps the data which is
delivered to the user. Jarvis is not only a scraper but also an assistant, it assists it's user with
the stock prices of the target companies based on the Corporate Action. As we know that
Corporate Actions have a significant impact on the stock prices of the companies, making the
stock price as a dependent variable for the Corporate Actions enabling Jarvis to perform
predictive actions based on the user requirements to deliver prominent results.
